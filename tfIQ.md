## 1. What is the use of .terraform.lock.hcl ??

The `.terraform.lock.hcl` file is used to record the exact versions of the provider plugins that Terraform uses for a project. Its main purpose is to ensure consistent and reproducible runs of Terraform across different machines and team members.

## 2. What would you do if a Terraform state file becomes corrupted or accidentally deleted?

Thanks for the clarification! Here's a solid **interview answer** to:

---

### ‚ùì **What would you do if a Terraform state file becomes corrupted or accidentally deleted?**

---

### ‚úÖ **Answer:**

If the Terraform state file gets corrupted or accidentally deleted, my response depends on whether we‚Äôre using a **local backend** or a **remote backend** like Azure Storage.

---

### üîπ **For Remote Backend (like Azure Storage ‚Äì which I mostly use):**

1. **Check for backups**:

   - Azure Storage keeps **versioning** or **soft delete** enabled for blobs.
   - I‚Äôd go to the storage account and **recover the previous state file version** using the Azure Portal, CLI, or PowerShell.

2. **Restore the blob**:

   - Using the portal or `az storage blob restore` command, I can restore the last known good version of `terraform.tfstate`.

3. **Validate**:

   - Once restored, I‚Äôd run `terraform plan` to ensure the current infrastructure matches the restored state and no drift has occurred.

---

### üîπ **If no backup is available or recovery is not possible:**

1. I would try to **recreate the state using `terraform import`**.

   - For each resource, I‚Äôd run:

     ```
     terraform import <resource_type.name> <resource_id>
     ```

   - This recreates the state from the actual infrastructure without changing it.

2. After importing, I‚Äôd run `terraform plan` to verify all resources are tracked properly again.

---

### üîê **Preventive Measures I Follow**:

- Always enable **blob versioning** or **state locking with remote backends**.
- Ensure **state file encryption** and **access controls** are applied.
- Take **manual state snapshots before critical deployments**.

---

## Explain Terraform‚Äôs declarative model.

Terraform uses a declarative model where I just define the desired end state of infrastructure in .tf files, like ‚ÄòI need an Azure App Service with autoscaling enabled and a SQL Database.‚Äô Terraform then compares that with the current state, creates an execution plan, and makes only the necessary changes. This ensures idempotency, drift detection, and consistent provisioning without me writing step-by-step instructions.

## What do we mean by immutability in Terraform? Why is it preferred over mutability in infrastructure changes?

In Terraform, immutability means that when infrastructure changes are required, Terraform often replaces the resource instead of modifying it in-place. This is preferred because it ensures consistency, eliminates configuration drift, and makes deployments more predictable. Immutable changes are safer, easier to roll back, and align well with modern DevOps practices like blue-green deployments. In contrast, mutable infrastructure can lead to hidden issues and harder-to-trace drift

## How does Terraform handle dependency management between resources? Can you override the implicit dependency graph?

Terraform builds an implicit dependency graph by analyzing references between resources. For example, if an EC2 instance uses a subnet‚Äôs ID, Terraform automatically ensures the subnet is created first. Independent resources are created in parallel. If I need to enforce ordering where no direct reference exists, I can override this using the depends_on argument. However, I use it sparingly to avoid unnecessary complexity and reduced parallelism.

## What are providers and provisioners? Why is relying heavily on provisioners generally discouraged?

Providers in Terraform are plugins that allow it to interact with different platforms like AWS, Azure, or Kubernetes. Provisioners, on the other hand, are used to run scripts or commands on a resource after it‚Äôs created or destroyed. While provisioners can be useful for small bootstrapping tasks, relying heavily on them is discouraged because they break Terraform‚Äôs declarative model, introduce non-idempotent behavior, and make infrastructure harder to maintain. The best practice is to use provisioners sparingly and rely on tools like Ansible or cloud-init for configuration management.

## What is the Terraform state file used for, and why is it critical?

The Terraform state file is a critical component because it maps the resources defined in code to the actual resources in the cloud. It allows Terraform to know what it manages, detect drift, and plan changes accurately. Without state, Terraform would have to recreate or reimport resources every time. That‚Äôs why teams typically store it in a secure remote backend with state locking and encryption, making it both collaborative and safe.

## How do you handle a corrupted or accidentally deleted state file?

If a state file is corrupted or accidentally deleted, my first step is to check if we‚Äôre using a remote backend like S3 or Azure Blob with versioning enabled and restore a previous version. If no backup exists, I would manually rebuild the state using terraform import to map each real resource back into Terraform‚Äôs management. Running terraform apply without a valid state is dangerous because Terraform might attempt to recreate everything, so restoring or reconstructing state is critical.

## Suppose your team uses remote backend with state locking enabled, but a colleague force-terminates a terraform apply. What issues can arise and how do you fix them?

When using a remote backend with state locking, if a colleague force-terminates an apply, Terraform may leave the state locked. This blocks further operations and could leave resources half-created. The fix is to use terraform force-unlock <LOCK_ID> to release the stale lock, then run terraform plan to check for drift. If resources were created but not recorded in state, I‚Äôd use terraform import to reconcile them. This ensures state and infrastructure are back in sync.

## What risks are there in using force-unlock, and how do you mitigate them?

The main risk of using terraform force-unlock is that it can lead to state corruption if another apply is still running, or it may leave Terraform unaware of resources that were created before the interrupted apply. To mitigate this, I first confirm no one else is running Terraform, then force-unlock, and immediately run a terraform plan to check for inconsistencies. If drift exists, I use terraform import or refresh to reconcile state. Storing state in a versioned backend also gives a safety net in case the state becomes corrupted.

## How do you perform a state migration from local to remote backend ?
To migrate state from local to Azure, I first create an Azure storage account and container. Then, I update the backend block in Terraform to point to Azure Blob Storage. Finally, I run `terraform init -migrate-state`, which uploads the existing local state to the remote backend. From then on, the state is stored in Azure for collaboration and locking. I also recommend enabling blob versioning for recovery.

## What will happen If I don't use -migrate-state flag while migrating state file ?

If I don‚Äôt use -migrate-state when switching to a remote backend, Terraform won‚Äôt copy the existing local state to Azure. The remote backend will start with an empty state, which makes Terraform think no resources exist. This can lead to resource duplication, drift, or require a full manual import of every resource. That‚Äôs why using -migrate-state is the safe and recommended way
