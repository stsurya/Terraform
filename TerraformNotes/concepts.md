## Terraform Variables

- Terraform variables provides a way to store the values and can be used throughout your terraform configuration.

Variables are defined in the variables block in your Terraform configuration file, where you can give a name and a default value. Please refer to the following snippet exaplaining how variables are defined inside terraform-

```
variable "<variable_name>" {
    type = string
    description = "some desc"
    default = "<default value>"
}
```

- Terraform variables can have various type such as string, number, boolean, list, map etc.
- Variables can be set in the command line when running Terraform commands using the `-var flag`.
- Variables can also be set using a separate file, called a variable file, using the `-var-file flag`.
- Variables can be accessed in Terraform configuration files using the var function, for example ` var.example_variable`.
- Variables are useful for storing values that may change between environments, for example, different values for test and production environments.
